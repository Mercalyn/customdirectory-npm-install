# customdirectory-npm-install

This file was created because on Windows you need to run the normal Windows shell to use 'npm install,' but the Windows shell always starts at C:/Windows whereas my custom nodejs path is at D:/nodejs and I cba to type that in every time. It'll install the package globally.
